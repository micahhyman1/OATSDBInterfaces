/** NotSupportedException is thrown to indicate that the client's request

 * example, because nested transactions are not supported, the Transaction
 * Manager throws this exception when a calling thread that is already
 * associated with a transaction attempts to start a new transaction. (A nested
 * transaction occurs when a thread is already associated with one transaction
 * and attempts to start a second transaction.)
